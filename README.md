This repo is a code challenge from VEO
Below is the screenshot of the work done so far

I implemented getAllNodes and getAllEdges endpoint as well as createNode endpoint,  but that is not used yet

On the frontend side there is a rendering of a graph using a third party library I found.

Frontend retrieves data, adapts it for displaying for the format library requires and shows it. Currently the root node is in center which I think should be easy to adapt and make sure it is on top
